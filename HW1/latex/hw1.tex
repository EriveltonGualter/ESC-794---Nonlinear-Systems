%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Question 1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Question}

The circuit shown in the figure below contains a nonlinear inductor and is driven by a time-dependent current source. Suppose that the nonlinear inductor is described by $i_L =I_0\sin(k\phi_L)$, where $\phi_L$ is the magnet flux of the inductor and $I_0$ and $k$ are constants. Using $\phi_L$ and $v_C$ as state variables, find the state equations.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Question 2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Question}
Use Matlab/Simulink to simulate the stable electronic oscillator in Example 8 in Lecture 1. Choose two sets of initial conditions that are different from the ones on pages 28-30 in this lecture, and produce the phase plane (or XY plane) plots and
plot output responses with the various initial conditions. 
In your simulation, please choose $A=1.5$, $V_1 =V_2 =1$, $L=1$, $C=1F$, and $R=0.1\Omega$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Question 3 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Question}
For the following system, find the equilibrium points and determine the type of each isolated equilibrium point:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\dot{x}_1 &= 2{x}_1 - {x}_1{x}_2 \\
\dot{x}_2 &= 2{x}^2_1 - {x}_2 
\end{eqnarray*}

By definition, the following equation must hold:

\begin{eqnarray}
0 &= 2{x}_1 - {x}_1{x}_2 \label{eq:3a} \\ 
0 &= 2{x}^2_1 - {x}_2   \label{eq:3b}
\end{eqnarray}

Replacing Equation \ref{eq:3b} in Equation \ref{eq:3a}, we have:

\begin{eqnarray*}
0 &= 2{x}_1 - 2{x}^3_1 \\
0 &= 2{x}_1(1 - {x}^2_1)
\end{eqnarray*}

Then, there are three solutions for $x_1$ and $x_2$

\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_{1e}\\x_{2e}
\end{pmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}
 0 & -1 & 1 \\
 0 & 2 & 2 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Question 4 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Question}
By plotting trajectories starting at different initial conditions, draw the phase portrait of the following LTI systems:

\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{x}_1 &= {x}_2 \\
\dot{x}_2 &= -10{x}_1-10{x}_2  
\end{eqnarray}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Question 4 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Question}
The phase portrait (or phase-plane plot) of the following system is shown below.
Mark the arrowheads and discuss the stability of each isolated equilibrium point


\begin{equation}
\dot{x}_1 = {x}_2 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\dot{x}_2 = {x}_1-2\tan^{-1}({x}_1+{x}_2) 
\end{equation}
